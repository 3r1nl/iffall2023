        <p>
            Cake:
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 3/4 granulated sugar</li>
            <li>5 large eff whites, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup of whole milk, at room temperature</li>
        </ul>

        Berries and Cream:
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/3 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh mixed berries</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">Tools</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>9 in Cake Pan</li>
                <li>Handheld or stand mixer with whisk attachment</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">Instructions</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li class="instructions">Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease three 8-inch or 9-inch
                cake pans,
                line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps
                the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. I recommend using nonstick spray for greasing. I also
                recommend 8 inch cake pans as the 9 inch cakes will be pretty thin.</li>
            <li class="instructions">Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li class="instructions">Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter on
                high speed until
                smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed
                together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add
                the egg whites. Beat on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream
                and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer
                on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low,
                slowly pour in the milk until combined. Do not overmix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to
                make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.</li>
            <li class="instructions">Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 22-24 minutes or until the cakes
                are baked
                through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean,
                it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely
                cool before assembling. </li>
            <li class="instructions">Make the whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk
                attachment, whip the
                heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract on medium-high speed until
                medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and
                are the perfect consistency for decorating cakes. Use immediately or cover tightly and chill in the
                refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Yields about 4 cups. </li>
            <li class="instructions">Assemble cake: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to
                slice a thin layer
                off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. (Discard thin layer or
                crumble over ice cream.) Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate.
                Evenly spread 1 heaping cup of whipped cream on top. I always use an icing spatula to spread. Arrange
                a single layer of mixed berries on top. Top with 2nd cake layer. Spread another 1 heaping cup of whipped
                cream on top, then a single layer of berries. Top with 3rd cake layer. Spread remaining whipped cream
                on top and garnish with fresh berries. Add a dusting of confectioners’ sugar on the berries, if desired,
                and/or garnish with fresh florals.</li>
            <li class="instructions">Chill the assembled cake, uncovered, for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day before
                slicing and serving.
                This time in the refrigerator helps the whipped cream thicken and makes cutting neater and easier.
                If chilling for longer than a few hours, you can carefully cover it with plastic wrap or use a cake
                carrier for storing in the refrigerator (what I always store my cakes in!). *Note that the berries
                could begin to release their juices if kept in the refrigerator for longer than 2 hours. For cutting,
                I recommend using your sharpest knife and cutting slowly.</li>
            <li class="instructions">Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
